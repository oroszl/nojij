This repository contains source code and documentaiton for a project aimed to extract classical Heisenberg model parameters from density functional theory codes that employ non-orthogonal basis sets, such as [siesta.](http://departments.icmab.es/leem/siesta/)

The package depends on some python packages that can be simply installed e.g. through pip:

- [sisl](http://sisl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for nice pythonic input/output for electronic structure codes
- [mpi4py](http://pythonhosted.org/mpi4py/) for parallel BZ integrals
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) for nice progressbars (not really necessary but fun)
